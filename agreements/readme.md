# SuperBenefit Agreements

These agreements are derived from proposals approved by SuperBenefit governance.

Agreements are organized here according to their governance domain, which should conform to [DAOIP-4: Proposal Types](https://github.com/metagov/daostar/discussions/50). Any policies derived from approved agreements should be recorded in the [/policies/](/policies/readme.md) directory and backlinked to the relevant agreement.

For information on how to update the agreement registry via governance proposal, please see [contributing.md](/docs/CONTRIBUTING.md). To learn how proposals are processed and (conditionally) approved for addition to this repo, see [governance.md](governance.md).
