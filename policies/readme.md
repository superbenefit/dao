# DAO Policies

These policies constitute the body of principles by which the DAO (including its platforms, systems, roles and protocols) will operate and self-govern in the fulfillment of its purpose.

Policies are distinct from [agreements](/agreements/index.md), which constitute the social contract held between members of the DAO. Policies may be derived from agreements, or they may be issued by roles with delegated policymaking authority

## Policy Domains

Policies in this repository are organized by *domain*. The policy domains currently in use are:

- [Metagovernance Policies](/policies/metagovernance/)
- [Administrative Policies](/policies/administration/)
- [Operational Policies](/policies/operations/)
