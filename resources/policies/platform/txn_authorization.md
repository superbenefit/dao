# Transaction Authorization Policy

All transactions queued in SuperBenefit's DAO-owned multisig contracts must be accompanied by a link to the authorization (such as a proposal) for the submitted transaction. If no authorization exists, do not submit the transaction.

Authorization links should be added to the transaction description in Den.
