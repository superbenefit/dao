# Proposal SPRB11: DAO Systems Transformation Repository/Library 

**PURPOSE:**

To build a repository of projects and DAOs that align with “systems transformation” and go beyond charity/philanthropy impact and include and demonstrate the interdependence and interplay of the following properties:
- Equitable access to opportunity, support, services, and resources.
- Regenerative and distributive economies.
- Self-determination, rights, and sovereignty of identity.
- Care and conservation of all life, ecosystems, knowledge, and cultures

The projects and DAOs will be guided by the following conditions (developed by Shaping Innovation Futures project) to be considered “systems transformation”:

**DESIGN:**

A core team for the project will be developed to include the following functions of project management, research, synthesis, mapping, technical design & formatting. The format of the repository will be determined by the contributors and could include one or more of the following - library, starter pack, design map etc. 
Four phases 1) Systems Transformation & web3 framework 2) Research projects and DAOs aligned with the systems transformation framework 3) Development of systems transformation repository tool 4) Synthesis and analysis of what has enabled and constrained the systems transformation projects and DAOs.

**MOMENTUM:**

@MBaldwin will support the co-creation and shaping of this with a team of contributors@AlexH @Ashraful.Impactrio @heenal @Nate  @Lewwwk @Rowan . We currently have projects in process and exploration with Northpine Foundation, Windfall Ecology Centre and Krause House. The Systems Transformation Repository will support the current work of SuperBenefit to better understand about what has enabled and constrained the projects and DAOs. The repository will also serve as a starting infrastructure for others in the web3 space who are looking for use cases and examples of "systems transformation projects and DAOs in the ecosystem.

**TIMELINE:**

Starting October 2022 with 4-6 weeks per phase. 

**DETAILS:**

SuperBenefit allocates 20,000 $SPRB to the project
- The project will have 4 phases including:
1) Systems Transformation & web3 framework (5000 $SPRB) 
2) Research projects DAOs aligned with systems transformation framework (5000 $SPRB) 
3) Development of systems transformation repository tool (5000 $SPRB) 
4) Synthesis and analysis of what has enabled and constrained the systems transformation projects and DAOs (5000 $SPRB)

Core team members will decide on where the tokens will be allocated as the project progresses.
- Tokens transferred to a multi-sig set up for use by the project.
