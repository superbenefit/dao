# SBP12: Design resourcing for the Future of Sport Roadmapping Project

**Context**
As part of the Krause House collaboration approved in SB9, Alex H and Lewwwk wish to engage Shadoe from Five and Dime to illustrate and design the "transformation map", the primary Future of Sport project output.

This will be of significant value in helping to communicate the substance of the output and ensure a quality representation of the input and contributions to the project.  It will also serve as valuable reference example of the work of the SuperBenefit community, and could potentially provide a template for comparable work in different contexts.

**Details**
We request a budget set-aside of $1,000 USDC for the completion of this work. Alex H will manage the relationship and budget, with final costs to be requested from treasury upon completion, up to a maximum of $1,000 USDC.
