# SBP13 - Allocating SPRB & USDC to projects to fund interim Rev 1 contributor rewards 

# Background
SuperBenefit is moving into an execution phase. We are still exploring and experimenting but there are several projects where we are executing against deadlines and are relying on contribution from our community to make this happen.

This proposal comes out of the General Circle - which is acting as the "cell of cells" (team of teams) with representation from each of the projects running at SuperBenefit. 

*Note - Over time this cell of cells will become better defined as we evolve our governance model. But it acts as the starting point for the sociocratic governance structure that will govern the operational side of SuperBenefit. Feel free to reach out to @rowan or any members of the DAO primitive team if you want to know more about how this is shaping up (or to become involved)*

# Purpose
As a result, for this next iteration of SuperBenefit we want to ensure that everyone contributing to SuperBenefit is rewarded appropriately and has the ability to genuinely participate in our governance.  We also want to ensure that we don't fail to progress on our plans because of financial constraint on any of our key contributors.  

# Design
To achieve this we propose 2 things:
1. Allocating meaningful rewards of #$SPRB for people contributing across SB's different projects (for work that has been done to date and going into the future).
2. Providing the two most contributor active projects with the greatest current need - the DAO Primitive/AIFS governance project and the System Transformation project - with some small amounts of USDC to reward the contributors that are crucial to these projects, so that we can ensure that we have the talent we need to execute.     

Each allocation of $SPRB and USDC will be made to the cells/projects/teams themselves (listed below) and they will have autonomy over how the resources are allocated within their cell/project/team (in line with the CELL primitive model we are developing).

It is intended that the USDC funds are allocated on the basis of need - where it is necessary to support contributors to maintain or increase their level of contribution. Whereas the allocation of $SPRB is intended to more closely reflect the overall level and value of contribution made by contributors over  #Rev1: Genesis. 

# Momentum
There is roughly USD9k (proceeds of previous NFT sales) currently in the SB treasury. Also, @MBaldwinand & @heenal have been collaborating with partner orgs to facilitate the purchase of additional SuperBenefit NFTs . This should contribute the equivalent of approximately CAD10k to the treasury in the next two weeks.

The General Circle, team acting as the "team of teams" (cell of cells) has agreed on the allocation schedule in this proposal based on the needs of the different cells/projects/teams they represent.  

*Note - This allocation is in line with the direction that SuperBenefit governance is moving, where overall governance authority dilutes to a larger community of stakeholders and current contributors (rather than being dominated by founders). And this "Community Governance" then empowers CELLS (teams) to coordinate between themselves on strategy and budgets ("Operational Governance") with final decisions on rewarding contributions made at the level of individual CELLS. *

# Timeline
This Proposal addresses immediate needs. Once this Proposal passes the allocations of SPRB can be transferred immediately. 

50% of the USDC may be transferred from the Treasury immediately, the remaining can be transferred once funds from new NFT purchases have been received (greater than 4 ETH).

# Details
1. Allocate a total of 100,000 $SPRB from from the SuperBenefit treasury to the corresponding cells/projects/teams:
- P-264 Systems Transformation Project 25k
- P-257 DAO Primitive development 45k
- Transformation mapping project 10k
- P-193 Community Experience 10k
- *Note - above allocations of $SPRB are in addition to already approved budgets that the projects may have. *

2. Allocate the following amounts of USDC to the corresponding CELLS from the SB treasury - 50% allocated immediately and 50% allocated when the above timeline conditions are met.
- P-264 Systems Transformation Project - USDC3k Total
- P-257 DAO Primitive development - USDC6k Total
