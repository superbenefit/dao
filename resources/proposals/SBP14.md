# SBP14 - Establish and fund an initial Cell to work on the Reimagining Power project

Authors: Rowan, Rathermercurial, Ananth

## Background

For the past 6 months SuperBenefit has been establishing a partnership with the Ontario Trillium Foundation (OTF), Equality Fund, Reimagine Institute and All in for Sport to continue the work that SuperBenefit has been doing on governance design and systems transformation.

As this collaboration ramps up we need to set up an initial team that can start to scope and implement the early phases of the project.

This proposal will authorise a Cell to be created and funded to do this initial work. As the project progresses this Cell will evolve and coordinate with other Cells to execute the project based on community proposals for how the project should proceed.

## Purpose

(what is the proposal for?)
To create and fund a Cell to kick off the Reimagining Power project.
The Cell team will work on:
- Initial governance design
- Early overarching project design
- Coordinating stakeholder partners and the set up of the stakeholder module and early project decision-making
- Then it will evolve its role as needed as the project takes shape and more operational Cells are created

## Practice

(how will this get done?)


### Core Team

- The core team for the Cell will be composed from the contributor list below and other SuperBenefit members and partners based on the starting needs of the project.
- The core team will change as the project evolves.
- The DAO Primitive team will support the set up of the core team.

### Cell State

Once this proposal is approved, the core team will set up a Cell State. This will create transparency around all the core functions of the Cell. It will define how:

- Decisions are made
- Treasury is governed and administered
- Changes to the Cell State are made
- Contributors are rewarded
- Tasks are managed

### Treasury

- After approval, the Cell will set up a multisig wallet to manage its treasury.
- The DAO Primitive team will take responsibility for setting up the multisig and transfer ownership of this to the core team as it is established.

## Progress

(what progress has already been made?)

- Funding for the project is close to approval. We should have confirmation soon after July 13.
- There are several other projects and potential funding that is imminent that will also contribute to the work that this project will engage in.
- We have already done a lot of work across other projects on the core governance primitives and practices that we will be leveraging for this initial project set up.

### Contributors

The following SuperBenefit contributors are already engaged in the project along with other partners:

- @MBaldwin
- @heenal
- @Lewwwk
- @Rowan
- @ShannyNFT
- @rathermercurial
- @Ananth

## First Steps

The initial work that the Cell will do is to scope the potential governance designs for the project itself. Because the project itself is also an experiment in designing for reimagining power, there is initial work to do prior to actually executing on the official set-up of the partnership and funding of the project. Because of this we are proposing resourcing this Cell to be able do this early work on the project.


## Details

- SuperBenefit allocates 5,000 USDC (or equivalent in Eth) to the project
- Core team members will decide on where the tokens will be allocated as the project progresses
- Tokens will be transferred to a multi-sig set up for use by the project
- Core team will set up a DAO-cell and Cell State so that there is transparency into the work that is being done and how tokens are being allocated
