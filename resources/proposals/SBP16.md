# SBP 16 - Revolution 1 SPRB Allocation

### Proposal

Allocate one million $SPRB to an allocation pool for the current revolution that is wrapping up. From that amount, further allocate the following:
* 100K to a Coordinape pool for core contributors over this period including Rowan, Michelle, Rather, Heenal, Naan and Alex. That group can choose to invite others to the Coordinape as they see fit.
* 100K to a retroactive contribution pool to be allocated by the Coordinape participants in the above allocation. The allocations may be made to anyone who did meaningful ongoing work during the current revolution (more than a single contribution).
* 100K to the DAO primitive cell for use in an ongoing incentive experimentation pool.

The remaining 700k would remain available for future Rev 1 allocations.

### Action

 If this proposal is passed, the DAO primitive cell will be responsible for facilitating the above actions with Treasury. If not, no action will be taken.
