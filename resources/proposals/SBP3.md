# SBP3: Proposal for Governance Research Project (Rev1)

## Summary

With this project we will to pull together a view of the landscape of governance innovation happening currently in web3. This will have a special focus on concepts like systemic resilience, meta-governance and approaches emerging to deal with key challenges that are showing up in DAO governance.


### Vision (what we are hoping for this project?)  
We intend to develop a useful high-level map of the governance innovation landscape in web3. This will be a valuable tool for us at SuperBenefit to better understand the problems and opportunities in web3 as we work towards invitations 2, 3 & 4. We also intend that it will produce insights that can be shared with the broader community via mirror posts and in collaboration with other players in the ecosystem.  

### Design insight (what insights are we leveraging to do this?) 
There are tensions appearing in governance models being used across the web3 space. This includes things like DAO governance being hijacked by players manipulating voting rules, tension about how to address bad behaviour in DAO management, voting mechanisms becoming overloaded by the decision-making requirements of growing DAOs etc. There is now a wave of governance innovation happening to try to solve these problems. With this project we intend to review and understand what is being experimented in real time, to help make sense of it and surface insights about what promising directions are emerging. Exploring and applying concepts like meta-governance, inverted and fractal governance models.

### Energetic momentum (what commitment and forward momentum does this project this have?) 
@Rowan, @Heenal and @MBaldwin are on board and committed to push this forward and design work has already begun. We have networks into folks in CCS who we will engage to partner in this work. 
@Lewwwk has offered us the use of his jet. 

## Proposal
SuperBenefit allocates 10,000 $SPRB to the project
- Core team members will decide on where the tokens will be allocated based on contribution as the project progresses
- Tokens to transferred to a multi-sig set up for use by the project (simple set up, possibly one signer to begin with)
