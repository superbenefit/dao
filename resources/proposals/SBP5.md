# SBP5: Proposal Contributor Guide (Rev 1)

## Summary
As Revolution 1 commences, we are proposing the development of a Contributor Guide to support the mission and work of SuperBenefit and to enable the mission to move faster. This guide will provide clarity to the SuperBenefit about how they can contribute to the mission and harness their gifts and skills. Broadening the range of contributors to SuperBenefit will enable SuperBenefit to move more swiftly towards achieving its mission, allow for the distribution of $SPRB to more individuals in an open and transparent fashion, and make SuperBenefit more resilient and diverse.

### Vision (what are we hoping for this project?)
We are proposing the development of a Contributor Guide to support the mission and work of SuperBenefit and to enable the mission to move faster. The Contributor Guide will provide clarity to the SuperBenefit community about the opportunities available to take up existing bounties that interest them or to make proposals they think are aligned with the #Ethos and #Invitations. Broadening the range of contributors to SuperBenefit will allow for the distribution of $SPRB to more individuals in an open and transparent fashion, and will make SuperBenefit more resilient and diverse.

The Contributor Guide will include what is SuperBenefit, onboarding protocols, bounties template and process, types of bounties and other ways for members get involved outside of bounties, and an outline of the tools we use to coordinate contributions. The Contributor Guide will be revised regularly and will evolve in future Revolutions. An initial phase of research will be completed as background and then a draft Contributor Guide will be developed for input from current contributors and the wider community. The Contributor Guide will be open source and will be freely offered as a template for other DAOs to benefit from.

### Design insight (what insights are we leveraging to do this?)
To build a dynamic and engaged DAO community, it is important for members to have both freedom and autonomy, and to clearly understand the ways they can make meaningful contributions toward the DAO's mission. Often, new members have a long incubation period in DAOs and we are looking for ways to accelerate people from new members to contributors within 15-30 days. With the #Invitations outlined in SuperBenefit's Come, Make Better Faster post https://superbenefit.mirror.xyz/8Icbwygio4EJfEvh8we9Xz4IcZxzWfjyzmlMGXlxxjc, this is an opportune moment to create micro-tasks and bounties for the SuperBenefit community and guest contributors to help move these proposals and projects forward in pursuit of our purpose and mission.

### Energetic momentum (what commitment and forward momentum does project this have?)
As a next step from the #193 Community Experience: Revolution 1 plan, the #Community Experience Squad feels an urgency for initiatives to onboard new contributors.
@MBaldwin & @heenal have done some preliminary research and scoping for this project and will contribute to its development and execution. @CarynTan from Crypto Culture & Society and Clarity has offered a contributor guide template and to review the guide. Many SuperBenefit community members have identified roles and have expressed interest in engaging in the various invitations. We are at a good acceleration point for engaging new members into SuperBenefit as well.

### Proposal
SuperBenefit allocates 10,000 $SPRB to the project
Core team members will decide on where the tokens will be allocated as the project progresses with an allocation of $SPRB to all contributors.
Tokens transferred to a new multi-sig wallet set up for use by the project.
