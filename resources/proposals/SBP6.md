# SBP6: Monthly budget for internal activities (Rev1)

## Background
In order to fund the ongoing activities of the individuals and teams within SuperBenefit, we need a regular amount of funding that can flexibly be applied to where it is needed. This can cover work being done by both core team members and others who are contributing to work that is not otherwise being funded. 

This needs to be a large enough amount of tokens to incentivise what we need but no so large that it will require burdensome process around it. Over time we anticipate adjusting this amount via a Treasury proposal. 

We also needs to have a decentralised way of allocating the tokens that can fairly reflect the work being done, as well as being a process that can scale. 
## Proposal 
Each month Treasury will allocate 10,000 $SPRB to a coordinape process for allocation to people working on internal SuperBenefit activities.
- Note: "Internal" activities refers to activities that are not funded through either a bounty or an existing project that has its own funded budget.

Members of the general circle (to start with) and later the wider SB team will allocate the funds via the coordinape process.
