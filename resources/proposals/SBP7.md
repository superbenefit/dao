# SBP7: Establish a budget to fund bounties (Rev 1)

## Background
In order for us to drive momentum and progress we need to have a budget to fund community bounties.

These bounties will be offered to the community to deliver specific activities for SuperBenefit.

This budget will be used to fund bounties for activities that don't fall under projects that have their own budgets already allocated.

This can also include micro-community bounties, small rewards to community members for contributions that do not come under official bounties. This will help engage more community members and broaden the proposal voting pool.

This needs to be managed by a process that is reasonably low friction so that this can happen smoothly and not become a burden/bottleneck. 

## Proposal
Treasury will allocate 100,000 $SPRB to a fund for community bounties and micro-community bounties/rewards.

This will go into a separate newly created bounties wallet
- This will be a multi-sig wallet with all current general circle members as signers 
- Transactions will require any 2 signers to confirm
- The wallet with be in GnosisSafe and on the Polygon network

Bounties will be proposed by squad leads and then approved via a general circle using the fist-to-five decision process in the general circle discord channel
